# React Project with Jest Testing

This repository contains a React application with unit tests powered by Jest. Jest is a delightful JavaScript testing framework, designed for simplicity and performance.

## Features

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Jest**: A comprehensive testing framework for JavaScript, providing support for assertions, mocking, snapshot testing, and more.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   \`\`\`bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   \`\`\`

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   \`\`\`bash
   cd your-repo-name
   \`\`\`

3. Install the project dependencies:

   \`\`\`bash
   npm install
   \`\`\`

## Running the Tests

You can run the tests using Jest by executing the following command:

\`\`\`bash
npm test
\`\`\`

This will run all tests located in files named \`*.test.js\` or \`*.spec.js\` inside the \`__tests__\` folder or next to the files they test.

### Watching Files for Changes

To have Jest watch files and rerun tests automatically upon saving changes, run:

\`\`\`bash
npm test -- --watch
\`\`\`

### Test Coverage

To check the test coverage, use:

\`\`\`bash
npm test -- --coverage
\`\`\`

This will generate a coverage report and output it to the terminal.

## Writing Tests

Jest is flexible enough to test React components, functions, or the entire behavior of your application. Here’s a basic example of how to write a test for a React component.

\`\`\`javascript
// ExampleComponent.test.js

import React from 'react';
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import ExampleComponent from './ExampleComponent';

test('renders the component with the correct text', () => {
  render(<ExampleComponent />);
  const linkElement = screen.getByText(/example text/i);
  expect(linkElement).toBeInTheDocument();
});
\`\`\`

## Custom Jest Configuration

If you need to customize Jest’s configuration, create a \`jest.config.js\` file in the root of your project and add the necessary configurations. Here's an example configuration:

\`\`\`javascript
module.exports = {
  setupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/setupTests.js'],
  testEnvironment: 'jsdom',
  moduleNameMapper: {
    '\\.(css|less|scss|sass)$': 'identity-obj-proxy',
  },
};
\`\`\`
